Title: C. DIY

Statement:
You are given a list of
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
. You need to pick
8
elements from the list and use them as coordinates of four points. These four points should be corners of a rectangle which has its sides parallel to the coordinate axes. Your task is to pick coordinates in such a way that the resulting rectangle has the maximum possible area. The rectangle can be degenerate, i. e. its area can be
0
. Each integer can be used as many times as it occurs in the list (or less).
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤25000
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains one integer
n
(
8≤n≤2⋅105
).
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
−109≤ai≤109
).
Additional constraint on the input: the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅105
.
For each test case, print the answer as follows:

Output
For each test case, print the answer as follows:
if it is impossible to construct a rectangle which meets the constraints from the statement, print a single line containing the word NO (case-insensitive);
otherwise, in the first line, print YES (case-insensitive). In the second line, print
