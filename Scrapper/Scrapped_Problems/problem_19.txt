Title: C. Alya and Permutation

Statement:
Alya has been given a hard problem. Unfortunately, she is too busy running for student council. Please solve this problem for her.
Given an integer
n
, construct a permutation
p
of integers
1,2,…,n
that maximizes the value of
k
(which is initially
0
) after the following process.
Perform
n
operations, on the
i
-th operation (
i=1,2,…,n
),
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤500
) — the number of test cases.
The only line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
5≤n≤2⋅105
) — the length of the permutation.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅105
.
For each test case, output the maximum value of
k
in the first line and output the permutation
p1,p2,…,pn
in the second line.
If there are multiple such permutations, output any.
For the first test case, the value of
k
is determined as follows:
k=0
initially.
The final value of
k
is
5
. It can be shown that the final value of
k
is at most
5
for all permutations of length
5
. Another valid output is
[2,3,1,4,5]
.
For the second test case, the final value of
k
is
7
. It can be shown that the final value of
k
is at most
7
for all permutations of length
6
. Other valid outputs include
[2,4,1,6,3,5]
and
[5,2,6,1,3,4]
.
