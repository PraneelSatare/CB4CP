Title: E. Beautiful Array

Statement:
A-Ming's birthday is coming and his friend A-May decided to give him an integer array as a present. A-Ming has two favorite numbers
a
and
b
, and he thinks an array is beautiful if its mean is exactly
a
and its median is exactly
b
. Please help A-May find a beautiful array so her gift can impress A-Ming.
The mean of an array is its sum divided by its length. For example, the mean of array
[3,−1,5,5]
is
12÷4=3
.
The median of an array is its middle element after sorting if its length is odd, or the mean of two middle elements after sorting if its length is even. For example, the median of
[1,1,2,4,8]
is
2
and the median of
[3,−1,5,5]
is
(3+5)÷2=4
.
Note that the mean and median are not rounded to an integer. For example, the mean of array
[1,2]
is
1.5
.
The only line contains two integers
a
and
b
.
In the first line, print the length of the array.
In the second line, print the elements of the array.
If there are multiple solutions, you can print any. It can be proved that, under the constraints of the problem, a solution always exists.

Input Specification:
Input
The only line contains two integers
a
and
b
.
−100≤a,b≤100
.
The length of the array must be between
1
and
1000
.
The elements of the array must be integers and their absolute values must not exceed
10
6
.

Output Specification:
Output
In the first line, print the length of the array.
In the second line, print the elements of the array.
If there are multiple solutions, you can print any. It can be proved that, under the constraints of the problem, a solution always exists.
