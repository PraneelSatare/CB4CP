An abbreviation of two strings
S
and
T
is interesting if there are at least two different ways to split the abbreviation into two non-empty substrings such that the first substring is a prefix of
S
and the second substring is a suffix of
T
.
You are given two strings
S
and
T
. You want to create an interesting abbreviation of strings
S
and
T
with minimum length, or determine if it is impossible to create an interesting abbreviation.
The first line consists of a string
S
(
1≤|S|≤200000
).
The second line consists of a string
T
(
1≤|T|≤200000
).
Both strings
S
and
T
only consist of lowercase English letters.
If it is impossible to create an interesting abbreviation, output -1.
Otherwise, output a string in a single line representing an interesting abbreviation of strings
S
and
T
with minimum length. If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.
Explanation for the sample input/output #1

Explanation for the sample input/output #2
The abbreviation belhijau is also interesting with minimum length, so it is another valid solution.
